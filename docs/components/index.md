# Components

Since Lunchbox is a Vue 3 custom renderer, it can support any Three.js class.

Out of the box, it supports the classes listed in the `autoGeneratedComponents` array in the source code. To add more classes, see [Extend](/components/extend/).

## Properties

Lunchbox can also support any Three.js property on any component. Vue props and directives (`ref`, `v-for`, `v-if`, `key`, etc) are not passed onto Lunchbox-created instances.

Lunchbox will do its best to use the correct type for the prop:

```
:scale="[2, 2, 2]"      // Vector3s that receive arrays will spread array values into <vector3>.set
:scale="2"              // Vector3s that receive numbers will be set via <vector3>.setScalar
:color="'blue'"         // colors will be set using `<color>.set`
```

You can also set nested props by replacing dots with dashes:

```
:position-x="2" // equivalent to <item>.position.x = 2
:scale-y="3"    // equivalent to <item>.scale.y = 3
:exampleEntry-z="5" // equivalent to <item>.exampleEntry.z
```

Lunchbox reserves the following props for internal use:

-   `args` - used when creating an instance of a Three.js class. `args` must be an array; its values will be spread into the instantiation method.

```html
<!-- a sphere with radius=15, widthSegments=32, heightSegments=16 -->
<sphereGeometry :args="[15, 32, 16]"></sphereGeometry>
```

:::tip One-time use args
Each Lunchbox component is only created once in its lifecycle, so `args` will only apply on instantiation:

```html
<template>
    <Lunchbox>
        <mesh>
            <sphereGeometry :args="[radius]" />
        </mesh>
    </Lunchbox>
</template>

<script>
    export default {
        data() {
            return { radius: 5 }
        },
        mounted() {
            // This will have no effect on the sphere - since the radius is 5 at instantiation,
            // the value 20 will not be used again.
            setTimeout(() => (this.radius = 20), 1000)

            // If you need a new sphere with the new radius, add the prop `:key="radius"`
            // to the mesh to reinstantiate the entire component on radius change:
            //
            // <mesh :key="radius">
            //  <sphereGeometry :args="[radius]"/>
            // </mesh>
            //
            // or edit the scale of the mesh for the same effect:
            //
            // <mesh :scale="radius === 5 ? 1 : 4">
        },
    }
</script>
```

## Events

All Lunchbox components emit an `onAdded` and `onReady` event:

```html
<mesh @added="yourAddedMethod" @ready="yourReadyMethod" />
```

`onAdded` fires when the instance has been added to its scene or parent. `onReady` fires when the instance has first been created - it may or may not exist in the scene yet. Both accept an object with the following properties:

```js
{
        instance, // the instantiated Three.js object
}
```

Additional events available to Lunchbox components are:

:::tip @ Naming
Note you can replace `on` with `@` in the event names below. `onClick` is the same as `@click`, etc.

| Name             | Parameters                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `onClick`        | `{ intersection: THREE.Intersection }` |
